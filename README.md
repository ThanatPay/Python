## Introduction
Content | Description 
--- | --- 
1: Strings Manipulation | Strings are a special type of a python class and written within Quotation Mark " ". This notebook shows [simple strings manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/01string_manipulations.ipynb).
2: Simple Math | Python can calculate Math function + - * ** / // %. This notebook shows [calculate Math with Python](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/02simple_math.ipynb).
3: If Else Elif Statements | if: check if something is True. else: check out of condition and must be after an if or elif statement. elif: statement allows you to check multiple expressions for True. This notebook shows [simple if, else, elif statement](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/03if_else_statement.ipynb).
4: Lists and List Manipulation | Lists are data structure in Python that are mutable or changeable or ordered sequence of elements. Lists are written within square brackets [ ]. This notebook shows [simple lists manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/04List_manipulations.ipynb).
5: For Loops | For loops are a common way to iterate over the elements of an object through a certain number of values. This notebook shows how to [iterate over objects with number of iterations](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/05for_loop.ipynb).
6: Tuple Manipulation | Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed (immutable) unlike lists (mutable). This notebook shows [simple tuples manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/06Tuples.ipynb).
7: Dictionary Manipulation | Dictionaries are unordered data structures that map keys into values. The value can be anything (lists, functions, strings, anything). The key has to be immutable (numbers, strings or tuples). This notebook shows [simple dictionary manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/07Dictionary.ipynb).
8: While Loop | While loop is't necessary to terate through a certain number of values, just keep going until condition evaluates to False. This notebook shows how to [iterate over objects without number of iterations](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/08while_loop.ipynb).
9: Class Implementation | Class is a code template for creating objects. This notebook shows [the various implementations of class](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/09class.ipynb).
10: Exception | Exception can handle any unexpected error in your Python programs and to add debugging capabilities in them. This notebook shows [simple exception](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/10exception.ipynb).

## DataFrame
DataFrame is a data structure that organizes data into a 2-dimensional table of rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. The size of the dataframe is uncertain. Table data may be different.

1: Numpy | NumPy is a library for the Python programming, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. This notebook shows using [NumPy manipulate vectors and matrices](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Pandas/1_Numpy.ipynb).
2: Pandas | Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool. This notebook shows using [Pandas manipulate data](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Pandas/2_Pandas.ipynb). And example using Pandas manipulate Youtube Trending Data Exploration ([Basic](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Pandas/3_Pandas_(Data_Set_Trending_YouTube_Video_Statistics).ipynb) and [Advance](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Pandas/4_Advanced_Pandas_(Data_Set_Trending_YouTube_Video_Statistics).ipynb))

## Data cleaning and preparation
Data cleaning and preparation is the process of preparing data for analysis. This includes identifying and removing errors, filling in missing values, and dealing with outliers. Data preparation can be a time-consuming process (the most data scientists spend most of their time cleaning data), but it's important to make sure your data is accurate and ready for analysis.
