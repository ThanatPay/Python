## Introduction
Content | Description 
--- | --- 
[1: Strings Manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/01string_manipulations.ipynb) | Strings are a special type of a python class and written within Quotation Mark " "
[2: Simple Math](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/02simple_math.ipynb) | Python can calculate Math function + - * ** / // %
[3: If Else Elif Statements](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/03if_else_statement.ipynb) | if: check if something is True. else: check out of condition and must be after an if or elif statement. elif: statement allows you to check multiple expressions for True
[4: Lists and List Manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/04List_manipulations.ipynb) | Lists are data structure in Python that are mutable or changeable or ordered sequence of elements. Lists are written within square brackets [ ].
[5: For Loops](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/05for_loop.ipynb) | For loops are a common way to iterate over the elements of an object.
[6: Tuple Manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/06Tuples.ipynb) | Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed (immutable) unlike lists (mutable).
[7: Dictionary Manipulation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/07Dictionary.ipynb) | Dictionaries are unordered data structures that map keys into values. The value can be anything (lists, functions, strings, anything). The key has to be immutable (numbers, strings or tuples).
[8: While Loop](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/08while_loop.ipynb) | While loop is't necessary to terate through a certain number of values. just keep going until condition evaluates to False.
[9: Class Implementation](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/09class.ipynb) | Class is a code template for creating objects.
[10: Exception](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Introduction/10exception.ipynb) | Exception can handle any unexpected error in your Python programs and to add debugging capabilities in them

## Pandas

[1: Numpy](https://github.com/ThanatPay/Python/blob/main/Pandas/1_Numpy.ipynb) | NumPy is a library for the Python programming, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
